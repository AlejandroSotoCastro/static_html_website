Actions we can do with our files/folders

## Moving around:

- where are we? - **pwd** => path to working directory
- view/list - **ls** => List files
- move into directory - **cd** <dir_name> => change directory
- move to parent directory => "**cd** .."
- show in file explorer => **open_command .** (opens current directory in file explorer)

## Manipulating files/directories:

- create: \* File: **touch**
  - Directory: **mkdir**

- delete file: **rm** <file_name>
- delete Directory: **rm -rf** <directory_name>  MAKE SURE TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE SO YOU DON'T DELETE YOUR WHOLE SYSTEM HAHA! (pwd --- ls)
- rename directory/file: **mv** <old_name> <new_name>

## Open a file with VS code:

- open: **code .**
